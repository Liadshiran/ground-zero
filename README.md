# ground-zero

Ground Zero provides a comparision between various GIS web libraries.

This project was built with the mindset of comparing different GIS web libraries
under the same conditions (machine capabilities, data configuration etc.) in order to 
choose the best WebGL library for interactive maps tailored to **your** use case. 

This project does **NOT** compare the various features of each particular library but rather 
compares each library under specific simulated scenarios.

## Getting Started

Run `npm start` to serve the application

## Supported comparisons
